# Hello-World!

Hello guys!!

I'm Lee Ann. I'm from California and attended medical school (also was a research associate at UCSF) before finding out that I much preferred web development, coding, and programming to pipetting!
So far, I love Austin and definitely need to check out more taco places here as I agree with this guide that tacos are awesome. Also partial to burritos.
